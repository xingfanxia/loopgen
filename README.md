# loopgen

Your loop died 10 minutes after you went to sleep. Blocked on a decision you could have made before it ever fired.

loopgen writes the prompt so it doesn't.

Hand it whatever you're trying to do: close a spec, push a benchmark, walk a frontend, build a vague idea. It works out which kind of loop that is, writes the prompt and the invariants, and resolves the decisions that would've stalled the loop 10 minutes in. Hand the result to a runner (`/goal` in Claude Code or Codex, or any ralph-based harness) and go to sleep. loopgen doesn't run the loop. It makes sure the loop survives the night.

## Install

Each skill is a plain directory with a `SKILL.md`. No plugin runtime. Symlink `loopgen/` into the directory your agent reads skills from (`~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code, `~/.codex/skills/` for Codex); anything that reads skill folders can use it. The unified skill is [`loopgen/`](loopgen/SKILL.md).

## How it actually works

You don't need any of this to use it. loopgen picks the shape and fills the blanks. It's here for when a loop drifts and you want to see why, or when you want to add to the family.

### The four archetypes

Pick by what you hand the loop, but you don't have to. loopgen classifies for you, and composes a hybrid when the intention sits between archetypes.

| Seed | Archetype | Halts on |
|---|---|---|
| A task with a definition of done | `goal` | `criteria-met`: one final-verify proves the frozen acceptance inventory |
| A benchmark to push | `frontier` | `frontier-exhausted`: five homeostasis axes balanced, no intervention left |
| A frontend to walk through | `story` | `storyboard-converged`: the visible product matches the storyboard |
| An idea to build out | `greenfield` | `stone-converged`: the artifact landed on the user's reframed target |

### How it composes

1. **Frontload audit.** Resolve every uncertainty the loop will need (motive, commands, paths, evaluator, scope) before composing. Unresolved items emit as a frontload preamble so you can close them before the loop fires.
2. **Classify.** Extract the intention's primitive values, score against each archetype's default bundle (weighted-Hamming over the varying axes), pick the nearest. A genuine tie is a hybrid; a contradiction (e.g. a `finite-criteria` target with an `equilibrium` halt) is a classification error → ask, never silently default.
3. **Compose.** Start from the archetype body, apply per-axis divergence patches, prepend the provenance preamble.
4. **Emit.** One self-contained prompt, ready for any runner.

The primitive vocabulary (the five axes the classifier scores on: target / halt / artifact / convergence / cadence; plus a consult tier the environment supplies, which overlays composition rather than steering classification), the four archetype definitions, the assembler, and the four emittable bodies all live under [`loopgen/`](loopgen/SKILL.md).

### The archetypes, in full

#### [`goal`](loopgen/archetypes/goal.md)

You have a task with a definition of done. Closes a finite acceptance inventory and halts when one final-verify proves the whole list. A 1-row inventory is fine: one bug with a repro, one review finding, one spec line.

You have a spec with a dozen acceptance lines and you want them all green by morning. `/loopgen` derives a prompt that walks the inventory, fixes each, and halts on `criteria-met` once a single final pass proves the whole list. See [`loopgen/references/oracle-principles.md`](loopgen/references/oracle-principles.md) for the underlying principles (binary oracle, oracle independence, anti-theater).

#### [`frontier`](loopgen/archetypes/frontier.md)

You have a benchmark to push. Picks the next intervention from the edge between what the artifact can already do and what it can't yet, runs it, scores it, and decides whether the frontier moved.

Your reviewer scores 0.71 on a held-out set and you want it past 0.75 before the team retros tomorrow. `/loopgen` halts on `frontier-exhausted` when all five homeostasis axes are in balance and no intervention is available, or `signal-starvation` when N consecutive iterations produce no new failing trace or finding.

#### [`story`](loopgen/archetypes/story.md)

You have a frontend to walk through. The artifact of interest is the user-facing promise of a product, not its code or its tests.

You shipped onboarding three weeks ago and the storyboard has drifted. Signed-out, signed-in, and post-trial each promise something; you don't know which still hold. `/loopgen` derives a prompt that picks the next story, gathers evidence across prompts, docs, code, and the observed UI, reconciles the row with what's there, and either implements it or records the gap. Halts on `storyboard-converged` when the visible product matches the storyboard within the current scope.

#### [`greenfield`](loopgen/archetypes/greenfield.md)

You have an idea to build out. Empty repo, no spec, no inventory, no evaluator. The failure mode is the inverse of `goal`'s: `goal` asks whether the list got closed; greenfield asks whether you ever committed to one.

The seed: "something that surfaces what's blocking me in Linear." You don't know what "it" is yet. `/loopgen` derives a prompt that names the artifact, builds the smallest scenario that proves it, and earns the next addition only when the current one holds. Halts on `stone-converged` when the artifact has landed on the user's reframed target and further iteration has no positive yield. The 11 green-field invariants live in [`loopgen/references/greenfield-invariants.md`](loopgen/references/greenfield-invariants.md).

It's a prompt-writer with strong opinions about going to sleep. That's all it is.
