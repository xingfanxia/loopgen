# Spark Loop

The **closing loop**: pick one known operator-visible problem, make the
smallest reversible fix, prove it with a narrow command, halt. Use
`spark-loop` when you already know what to close; use `frontier-loop`
when you don't.

This skill derives the prompt — it does not run the loop. The emitted
prompt is runner-agnostic: `/loop`, `/goal`, and external harnesses (gnhf,
cocc, ralph) are all valid runners; a runner re-invokes the loop. The
discipline below keeps each iteration narrow, evidence-backed, and honest.

The emitted prompt lives in
[`references/spark-prompt-template.md`](references/spark-prompt-template.md).
This file explains how to decide whether a Spark loop is appropriate and how to
fill the template.

## Core framing

A Spark loop is a **seam-closure** loop:

- one live seam per iteration
- one live anchor per accepted change
- one narrow proof surface per seam
- one small reversible diff

It does not search broadly. It cashes out already-known product, performance,
or failure-legibility seams quickly and cleanly.

The short version:

- the frontier loop moves the frontier
- the Spark loop seals its seams

## When to use it

Use this skill when the repository is already past evaluator bootstrap and the
next useful work is closure-shaped:

- resolving review feedback
- closing a reproducible operator-facing bug
- tightening a failure envelope
- removing measured avoidable work from a real path
- hardening a known false-green zone with a discriminative selector
- compressing a repeated workaround into a canonical path

## When not to use it

Do **not** force Spark onto a repo that still needs frontier work.

Prefer `frontier-loop` when:

- the repo lacks a cheap inner channel
- there is no narrow proof channel for the seams you care about
- the main problem is evaluator blindness or ramp incompleteness
- the work is architectural search, not closure
- the model needs wide context more than fast local iteration

If the repo is almost closure-ready but missing one critical proof surface,
allow at most one bootstrap move to create that surface, then return to seam
closure immediately.

## Closure-fit check

Before emitting a Spark prompt, inspect:

1. build / test / validate commands
2. strongest memory surfaces (review findings, run artifacts, ledgers, commits)
3. live operator seams (open findings, failing traces, perf regressions,
   repeated workarounds)
4. proof surfaces (selectors, focused integration tests, perf traces)

Classify the repo:

- **closure-ready**: a cheap inner channel exists, at least one
  *discriminative* narrow proof channel exists (one that can distinguish
  correct from incorrect behavior for a named anchor — not merely a green
  command), and there is at least one *admissible* live anchor (see below).
  No product semantics, architecture, or evaluator shape needs discovery.
- **partial-closure**: as above but exactly one narrow proof surface is
  missing; **one** bootstrap move is allowed for the whole run — not one
  per seam — and only to build the smallest proof surface for an
  already-admissible anchor. If the bootstrap needs architectural search,
  evaluator infrastructure, or multi-subsystem work, the repo is `not-fit`.
- **not-fit**: no cheap inner channel, no discriminative proof channel, no
  admissible live anchor, or the work needs evaluator/architecture
  discovery; route to `frontier-loop`.

An **admissible live anchor** names a specific current evidence item — an
open review finding, a failing/flaky test with a command, an operator bug
with a reproducible symptom, a measured regression on a named path, or a
known false-green with a concrete wrong behavior. A generic seam family, a
TODO, broad dissatisfaction, or a self-authored hypothesis is not
admissible. If no admissible anchor exists, the repo is `not-fit`.

## Frontloading discipline

Loops fail when they self-terminate blocked on a decision the user could
have made before the loop fired. The derivation step's job is to
**frontload every uncertainty** so iteration runs through the night
without blocking.

At derivation time, for every thing the loop might need (motive, anchors,
commands, scope, fixture, …), do one of:

1. **Resolve it now.** If the host has an AskUserQuestion-style tool,
   use it. Otherwise print the uncertainty prominently in the derivation
   response so the user can answer before launching.
2. **Default + Alignment Review.** Pick the smallest reversible default
   and record an Alignment Review.
3. **Mark as escalate candidate.** Only for the truly irreversible.

Anything left over is a **derivation gap** — a future block waiting to
happen. The Pre-flight Frontload audit (below) lists what was resolved /
defaulted / deferred; the emitted prompt's halt-cause classifier flags
`derivation-gap` halts so the next derivation pass closes them.

## Derivation procedure

### Pre-flight: Frontload audit

Before §1, walk this checklist. For each item: **resolve**
(AskUserQuestion if available, else print prominently), **default +
Alignment Review**, or **escalate-mark**. Record in `loop/STATE.md`
under `frontload:` and prepend a brief frontload preamble to the
emitted prompt.

- **Motive** — one-sentence goal.
- **Admissible live anchor inventory** — concrete current evidence
  items, not generic seam classes (open finding · failing test +
  command · operator bug + repro · measured regression on a named path
  · known false-green with concrete wrong behavior). If none are
  admissible, declare `not-fit` and route to `frontier-loop`.
- **Closure posture** — `closure-ready` / `partial-closure` / `not-fit`.
- **Bootstrap move** — if `partial-closure`: which one anchor needs it?
- **Cheap inner channel** — exact command.
- **Narrow proof channel** — smallest discriminative reproducer / selector
  for each anchor.
- **Outer channel** — broader proof run for checkpoints.
- **Scope manifest** — allowed / forbidden surfaces.
- **Forbidden shortcuts** — `--no-verify`, mocked integration, etc.
- **Parameter** — `{{QUIET_SIGNAL_N}}`.

A derivation that doesn't close all of these — at least to defaults —
emits a frontload preamble naming the open gaps so the user can decide
before sleeping.

### 1. Inspect the evidence surface

Read the repo's actual commands and artifacts. Record:

- cheap inner channel
- narrow proof channel
- outer channel
- strongest available memory surfaces, in this order:
  1. externally reviewed findings
  2. typed or machine-derived artifacts
  3. self-authored ledger prose
  4. commit narratives

If only weak surfaces exist, say so explicitly in the emitted prompt.

### 2. Identify live seam classes

Find the seams that matter now. Typical Spark seam families:

- operator-facing ambiguity
- degraded failure legibility
- empty/no-op paths doing unnecessary work
- selector gaps around a known false green
- repeated multi-step workaround
- wrapper behavior that hides or distorts real outcomes

Turn the repo's actual seams into a short priority list for the prompt.

### 3. Define the reward channels

Every Spark prompt needs three channels:

- **Cheap inner channel**: runs every iteration
- **Narrow proof channel**: smallest selector or reproducer that settles the seam
- **Outer channel**: broader proof run used at checkpoints or after cross-flow claims

If one is missing, either allow one bootstrap move or decline Spark.

### 4. Encode seam discipline

The emitted prompt must enforce:

- exactly one live anchor per accepted change
- exactly one seam family per accepted change
- proof before acceptance
- artifact discipline: keep only truth-bearing artifacts
- same-family admissibility: repeated same-shape work needs a fresh trace or new anchor
- fake-progress detectors: no freshness churn, wrapper churn, or unmeasured perf theater

### 5. Scope the loop

Add repo-specific scope if the user gave it or the repo strongly implies it:

- preferred edit surfaces
- forbidden areas
- proof commands that must run for certain subsystems
- forbidden shortcuts

### 6. Assemble the prompt

Start from
[`references/spark-prompt-template.md`](references/spark-prompt-template.md).
Fill in:

- motive
- runner contract (sibling skills share an identical block; keep in sync)
- judgment default — narrow reversible judgment + Alignment Review;
  sibling skills share an identical block; keep in sync
- closure posture (`closure-ready` or `partial-closure`)
- allowed bootstrap note if needed
- cheap / narrow / outer channels
- trusted artifact surfaces
- live anchor classes
- priority seams
- scope and forbidden shortcuts
- quiet-signal checkpoint count

### 7. Emit

Return:

- the final repo-specific Spark prompt
- a short rationale:
  - why Spark fits
  - which channels it will use
  - whether one bootstrap move is sanctioned
  - what the strongest live seams are

If the repo is `not-fit`, do not emit a Spark prompt as if it were safe.
Explain why and route to `frontier-loop`.

## Quality bar

A good Spark prompt makes the model:

- pick one seam, not three
- prove closure, not just claim it
- preserve only artifacts that settle the seam
- stop when the signal goes quiet instead of mining polish

A bad Spark prompt produces:

- freshness churn
- wrapper churn
- repeated same-family micro-edits with no fresh trace
- performance claims with no before/after evidence
- bookkeeping presented as product progress
