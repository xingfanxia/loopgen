# Loopgen

`/loopgen` derives a repo-specific, **runner-agnostic** loop prompt — `/loop`,
`/goal`, and external harnesses (cocc, ralph) are all valid runners; they
differ only in invocation. It is a **hybrid dispatcher + compositional
generator**: it runs a shared pre-flight audit, classifies the task to its
nearest *archetype* by extracting primitive values, composes the prompt by
combining those values (defaulting to the nearest archetype's presets and
diverging where the task demands), and emits with a provenance preamble.

It replaces the four legacy loop skills, whose irreducible cores now live as
archetype reference documents (`archetypes/*.md`) and whose shared
infrastructure is the primitive vocabulary (`primitives/*.md`). Output is
backward-compatible: a pure archetype reproduces the legacy skill's prompt plus
a provenance preamble.

Invoke **once per run** to author or revise a prompt; the loop's per-iteration
playbook lives in the composed `loop/PROMPT.md`, not here. Invoke in
**Diagnostic mode** to retrofit a drifting loop.

## When to invoke

- "derive a loop / write me a loop for X"
- "make this an overnight / autonomous loop"
- any per-archetype loop intent: closing a finite checklist, pushing a
  benchmark, walking a storyboard, or building an idea from zero
- a task that mixes archetypes (e.g. frontier evidence discipline + story
  chapter cadence) — loopgen is the only skill that composes hybrids

## Do NOT invoke when

- the user wants a one-off plan, not an iterative loop → `/architect`
- the user wants to *run* a loop now → that is the runner's job (`/loop`,
  `/goal`, `/schedule`); loopgen only generates the prompt
- pure debugging → a debugging tool, not a loop

## The primitive vocabulary (single source of truth)

Phase 2 classifies against this matrix. It is locked; extend it only when ≥2
archetypes meaningfully differ on a new axis (the vocabulary-axis test).

**Axes that vary by archetype** (the five the classifier weights):

| Axis | Values | frontier | goal | story | greenfield | wt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `target-shape` | finite-criteria · frontier-expanding · promise-discovery · discovery-reframing | frontier-expanding | finite-criteria | promise-discovery | discovery-reframing | 3 |
| `halt-shape` | terminal · equilibrium · checkpoint-with-reopen · manual-gated | equilibrium | terminal | checkpoint-with-reopen | manual-gated | 3 |
| `artifact-shape` | prompt-only · acceptance-inventory · storyboard · rubric+intent · findings-ledger | findings-ledger | acceptance-inventory | storyboard | rubric+intent | 3 |
| `convergence-shape` | criteria-completion · frontier-exhaustion · capstone-plus-closer · stone-reframe · iteration-cap | frontier-exhaustion | criteria-completion | capstone-plus-closer | stone-reframe | 2 |
| `cadence-shape` | sync · checkpoint-gated · chapter · deferred-fire-and-forget | checkpoint-gated | sync | chapter | checkpoint-gated | 1 |

Max weighted-Hamming distance is **12** (3+3+3+2+1). `consult-capability`
(tier-0..3) is **environment-detected, not archetype-varying** — it is a
composition *overlay* that changes which sections Phase 3 emits, and does
**not** participate in classification distance. Its tiers are defined below.

**Shared primitives** (constant across archetypes; in every composed prompt):
`runner-contract`, `judgment-default`, `evidence-tier`, `frontload-audit`,
`halt-cause-classifier`, `diagnostic-pattern`, `evaluator-maturity` (T0–T6),
`queue-as-second-artifact`.

**Forbidden divergences** (identity-breaking; never compose — route away):

- `goal` cannot take `target-shape` `frontier-expanding`/`discovery-reframing`,
  nor `halt-shape` `manual-gated`.
- `frontier`/`greenfield` cannot take `target-shape` `finite-criteria`.

**Contradictions** (classification error → AskUserQuestion, never silent
default): `target: finite-criteria` with `halt: equilibrium`/`manual-gated`, or
with `convergence: frontier-exhaustion`.

**`consult-capability` tiers** (detected at frontload time — probe for
`mcp__agentify-desktop__*`, other `mcp__*` tools, `/second-opinion`,
`/agentify`, PAL): `tier-0` none → drop scheduled-consult sections + substitute
a human-look gate; `tier-1` human-bridge handoff; `tier-2` single programmatic
consult; `tier-3` rich fabric (blind adversarial + multi-modal). All archetypes
default `tier-0` if undetected — never assume a channel exists.

## Phase 1 — Frontload audit

Run the universal pre-flight from `primitives/frontload-audit.md`, plus the
nearest archetype's extra items (named in each `archetypes/*.md`). For every
item: **resolve** (AskUserQuestion if the host has it, else print prominently),
**default + Alignment Review**, or **escalate-mark** (irreversible only).

Always assess `consult-capability` here (the bodytxt-learned move): detect the
tier and record it; it changes which sections Phase 3 emits.

Record results under `loop/STATE.md` `frontload:` and produce the frontload
preamble (resolved / defaulted / open gaps). Anything unresolved, undefaulted,
and unmarked is a **derivation gap** — name it explicitly; the emitted prompt's
halt-cause classifier flags `derivation-gap` halts so the next pass closes it.

## Phase 2 — Primitive extraction + archetype classification

1. **Extract** a value for each varying axis from the task description, using
   the detection heuristics in each `primitives/<axis>.md`.
2. **Check contradictions** first. If the bundle hits a contradiction pair,
   HALT classification and fire AskUserQuestion with the conflicting axes — no
   silent default.
3. **Classify.** Compute weighted-Hamming distance from the bundle to each
   archetype's defaults (weights above). The nearest archetype is the shorthand
   reference. **Be decisive — pick one archetype; do not present a menu.**
4. **Name divergences.** Every axis whose value differs from the nearest
   archetype's default is a divergence; record `axis → value (source-archetype
   or "task")`.
5. **Ties = genuine hybrid.** A genuine hybrid is *equidistant* (or near-equal,
   margin ≤1) between two archetypes — e.g. distance 5 to one and 5–6 to another.
   There, pick the higher-weight-match archetype as the shorthand and name the
   other's contributions as divergences; if still ambiguous, fire AskUserQuestion
   with the two candidates. Do **not** treat a low-distance task as a hybrid: a
   task at distance 3 from story and 9 from everything else (e.g. bodytxt — a
   story loop with a `frontier-expanding` target) is **story with one
   divergence**, not a frontier+story tie. No equidistant hybrid has yet been
   observed in a real run; until one is, a large margin means snap decisively to
   the nearest. (These distances are exact arithmetic over the matrix above —
   the eyeball that once called bodytxt a "hybrid" is the failure mode computing
   them guards against.)

Emit a structured classification: `{archetype, runnable, target-status,
divergences[], consult-tier, evaluator-tier}`, where `target-status` is `defined`
or `UNDEFINED → derivation-gap`, and `runnable` is `false` whenever a slot the
loop needs to fire (dimension, stop rule, scope, evidence signal) is unbound. A
clean archetype match — even an exact one — is a *candidate*, not a launchable
loop: the *preintent* read is that "improve the codebase" classifies as `frontier`
yet binds no dimension or stop rule, so it emits `{archetype: frontier, runnable:
false}` with those as derivation gaps (see `primitives/target-shape.md`). No
silent defaults — every divergence, every unbound slot, and an undefined target
is visible.

## Phase 3 — Compose

Follow `templates/composed-prompt.md`. In short: load the nearest archetype's
body (`templates/bodies/<archetype>-body.md`), resolve `{{INCLUDE}}` markers
from `primitives/*.md`, fill placeholders from Phase 1, prepend the provenance
preamble, apply divergence patches, apply consult degradation, strip any
section with an unsubstituted placeholder (warn if any survive), verify halt
semantics, and emit.

The provenance preamble MUST enumerate the archetype, every divergence + its
source, the consult tier, and the frontload gaps. If a section says "the
archetype" without provenance naming the composing values, the composition is
invisible — fix it.

The emitted prompt MUST also distinguish invocation halt from archetype
completion. Shared halt causes (`genuine-escalate`, `derivation-gap`,
`signal-starvation`, `wrong-loop`) are not completion claims by themselves.
Only the archetype-terminal success cause may say the loop is complete. If a
prompt can halt on a shared cause, it must tell the runner to report the
frontier/queue/story as still open and list the unresolved artifact rows.
It must also require a full search-surface scan before any non-terminal halt,
so one blocked row cannot stop a frontier/story/greenfield/goal loop while
another in-scope evaluator, observability, specification, verifier, or queue
repair move remains.

## Phase 4 — Emit + surface decision

**Default surface: file.** Write `loop/PROMPT.md` + `loop/STATE.md`, plus the
nearest archetype's extra artifact(s):

- `goal` → `loop/ACCEPTANCE.md` (frozen inventory)
- `story` → `docs/storyboard.{md,yaml}`
- `greenfield` → `loop/RUBRIC.md` + `loop/INTENT.md` (+ `loop/README.md`)
- `frontier` → a findings ledger + trace/benchmark locations (suggest, don't
  silently invent, if the repo lacks a convention)

If the user invoked mid-conversation without asking to save, emit **chat-only**
with an offer to write the files.

### The kick-off (runner invocation)

After emitting, give the operator the **pointer kick-off** — the line they paste
into a runner to start the loop. It is a **bare pointer**: the runner verb, the
path to the prompt, and a one-phrase identity. Nothing else.

> `/<runner> read loop/PROMPT.md and execute as <one-phrase loop identity>.`
>
> e.g. `/goal read loop/PROMPT.md and execute as the hybrid-pareto benchmarking loop.`

A runner (`/goal`, `/loop`, ralph, cocc) re-sends the *same* prompt every
iteration (see `primitives/runner-contract.md`), so the kick-off must be
**iteration-agnostic** and carry **no instruction content** — every rule (which
file is the goal, where `STATE.md` is, the iteration protocol, the bootstrap
gate) lives in `loop/PROMPT.md`, the single source. If you are tempted to add a
clause to the kick-off ("…and start with…", "…loop/STATE.md tells you where you
are"), put it in `PROMPT.md` instead. NEVER bake first-iteration language into
the kick-off ("begin with the bootstrap", "first, instantiate…") — on iteration 2
it mis-fires, re-running one-time setup.

This only works if `PROMPT.md` is **re-entrant**: all bootstrap /
inventory-instantiation / one-time work must be **self-gated on durable state** in
`loop/STATE.md` (`iteration: 0`, "no inventory / storyboard / ledger yet"), run
once then skipped. The canonical self-gate shape is story-body's `## Bootstrap
mode` (enter when the artifact doesn't exist; exit when the first unit can
advance); every archetype with iteration-0 setup (goal-inventory,
greenfield-preloop, frontier-ledger-seed) needs the same gate — verify the
composed `PROMPT.md` has it before emitting, or the pointer kick-off is unsafe.

Then present the menu:

- **Approve** — keep the emitted files.
- **Modify** — the user overrides one or more primitive values; rerun Phase
  2.5–3 with the overrides and re-emit.
- **Abort** — discard.

Return a one-paragraph rationale: archetype + divergences, consult tier,
evaluator tier (if applicable), and any open frontload gaps.

## Diagnostic mode

Invoked to retrofit a drifting loop, not author a new one. Follow
`primitives/diagnostic-pattern.md`: read the current `loop/PROMPT.md` +
`loop/STATE.md` + the queue artifact + ledger; **classify which archetype the
loop currently is** (it may have drifted from its declared archetype — flag the
drift first); score against that archetype's failure modes (`archetypes/*.md`);
emit a **minimal** `loop/PROMPT.md` mutation (inline edit, never a rewrite);
write a ⚠️ block to `loop/STATE.md`.

## Anti-patterns

- **Forcing a hybrid into one archetype.** When the task is genuinely mixed,
  do not snap to the nearest and drop the rest — name the divergences.
- **Pretending consult capability exists at tier-0.** Degrade gracefully;
  substitute a human-look gate; record it in provenance.
- **Silent defaults on a contradiction.** Contradictory primitives are a
  classification error → ask the user.
- **Primitive-vocabulary inflation.** Add an axis only when ≥2 archetypes
  meaningfully differ on it.
- **Invisible composition.** Every divergence axis must appear in the
  provenance preamble with its source.
- **Dead sections.** Strip any section whose placeholder was not substituted.

## Composability

| Direction | Skill | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| upstream | `/architect` | conceptual parent; an architect blueprint is a first-class `goal` criteria source |
| upstream | `/oracle-design` | complementary for the `goal` archetype's verifier matrix |
| downstream | `/loop`, `/goal`, `/schedule` | runners that execute the emitted `loop/PROMPT.md` (untouched — the format is structurally identical to legacy output) |
| downstream | `/provision`, `/route` | may still name the removed loop commands; repoint to `/loopgen` |
| sibling | `frontier-loop`, `goal-loop`, `story-loop`, `greenfield-loop` | retired and removed; their archetype cores live in `archetypes/*.md` |
