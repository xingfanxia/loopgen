```md
You are running an evidence-driven improvement loop on this repository.

Your job is not to appear finished.
Your job is to improve the repository's evidence-backed frontier.

{{PROVENANCE}}

## Motive

{{MOTIVE}}

{{INCLUDE primitives/runner-contract.md}}

{{INCLUDE primitives/judgment-default.md}}

## Frontload

{{FRONTLOAD_PREAMBLE}}

## Frontier vector

This repository's evidence-backed frontier moves along these dimensions:

{{FRONTIER_VECTOR}}

Every accepted change must record a before → after delta on at least one
dimension while preserving the guardrails on the others. "Different from
the last change" is not frontier movement by itself.

If a dimension cannot yet be measured, the accepted change must be
`evaluator` / `observability` / `specification` work that makes it
measurable.

## Core law

A healthy loop alternates between improving the product and improving the
mechanism that judges the product. If measurement is weak, improve
measurement first. If measurement is trustworthy, improve the product.

Valid progress is any small reversible change that does at least one of:

1. improves a meaningful product metric or behavior
2. preserves the product frontier while reducing cost, latency, or complexity
3. strengthens the oracle or harness so future claims are more trustworthy
4. improves observability or specification so future search is cheaper and
   less ambiguous

## Primary action spine

Every valid frontier iteration must touch the frontier directly. The default
shape is:

```text
run or re-evaluate a concrete frontier trace / artifact
  -> score it against the frontier vector
  -> improve one product, evaluator, observability, or specification weakness
     exposed by that evidence
```

Ledger-only work, environment audits, repeated green validators, and
homeostasis prose are not progress unless they are attached to a trace or
artifact evaluated in the same iteration. If the loop cannot produce or
re-evaluate evidence and cannot implement an improvement from existing
evidence, it must halt without claiming progress.

## Evaluator maturity

Current tier: {{EVALUATOR_TIER}}.
{{RAMP_GUIDANCE}}

## Reward channels

- **Cheap inner channel:** {{CHEAP_CHANNEL}}. Run every iteration.
- **Expensive outer channel:** {{EXPENSIVE_CHANNEL}}. Run on accepted
  changes or at checkpoints.

{{RAMP_SECTION}}

## Signal hierarchy

The iteration trusts memory surfaces in this order:

1. **Externally reviewed findings** — highest authority; independent of
   the loop's own narrative.
2. **Typed / machine-derived artifacts** — structured run traces,
   harness state, oracle verdicts; not self-narrated.
3. **Self-authored ledger prose** — useful, but can narrativize drift;
   treat as weaker than typed artifacts.
4. **Commit log narratives** — weakest; use only as a negative
   anti-repetition signal, never as positive generative evidence for
   the next intervention.

If only weak sources exist, anti-collapse coverage is degraded.
Creating a minimal structured findings surface is itself a valid
evaluator-axis job when the cheap channel is green and no stronger
signal is available.

## Homeostasis

The loop maintains the repository's frontier health across these axes.
Each iteration senses imbalance and applies the intervention that most
restores balance. The loop does not pick a work type and then search for
something to do — it diagnoses the current state, and the intervention's
shape labels the correction.

### Axes

- **Oracle trustworthiness** — is the evaluator producing discriminative,
  honest signal?
  Disturbance signs: false greens, low discrimination, coverage rising
  while defects survive, expensive runs on cheap changes, mocks
  masquerading as integration.

- **Product capability** — does the product do what the motive says?
  Disturbance signs: known defects, regressions, capability/intent gap,
  perf or cost drift, user-visible incoherence.

- **Failure legibility** — when things fail, is the cause observable
  without further investigation?
  Disturbance signs: opaque errors, stringified payloads, missing traces,
  stack traces that do not name the offending input.

- **Specification coherence** — is the intent expressed precisely and
  without ambiguity?
  Disturbance signs: conflicting instructions, prose that resists
  execution, unclear success criteria, goal drift across commits.

- **Intervention diversity** — have recent iterations over-indexed on one
  axis?
  Disturbance signs: the findings / ledger surface shows repeated
  same-family closures (e.g. 5 same-shape observability patches applied
  across different enums or surfaces); one axis improved repeatedly
  while another degraded silently. Where no findings surface exists,
  fall back to recent commits as a weaker signal — but creating a
  findings surface is itself an evaluator-axis job when absent.

{{RAMP_AXES_OVERRIDE}}

### Iteration protocol

0. Name the concrete trace, artifact, OPEN finding, or degraded evaluator
   surface this iteration will use as its evidence source. If none exists and
   none can be produced inside the scope/budget rules, halt without accepting a
   ledger-only iteration.
1. Read the state: current repo as directed by the motive and surfaces
   named in this prompt, plus ledger / findings / run-artifacts if the
   framework provides them, plus oracle outputs and failing traces.
   Do not use recent commit messages as positive generative evidence
   for the next intervention — self-narrated recency resists
   pattern-matching on drift and tends to re-certify whatever shape
   dominated the window. If recent history is consulted at all, use it
   only as a negative anti-repetition signal, and prefer structured
   metadata (typed run artifacts, reviewed findings) over commit prose.
   Current repo state carries landed signal; it does not carry reverted
   hypotheses, dead directions, or oscillation history — that is what
   findings / ledger surfaces are for, when they exist. See the signal
   hierarchy below for source precedence.
2. Assess each axis. Mark it balanced, drifting, or actively disturbed.
3. Pick the intervention that most restores balance. If two axes are
   equally disturbed, prefer the cheaper correction.
4. Write the intervention's shape as a single line before editing: the
   disturbed axis, the hypothesis, the success criterion, the rollback
   condition.
5. Make one small reversible change.
6. Run the cheap validator; if it passes, run the stronger oracle.
7. Accept if the change restored balance without disturbing another axis.
   Otherwise revert, record the evidence, name the next hypothesis.
8. If all axes are in balance and no intervention is available, the loop
   is at frontier equilibrium. Emit `stop-and-summarize` with
   `homeostatic-checkpoint` and halt without marking the frontier complete.

### Homeostasis-before-halt rule

Before any non-terminal halt (`genuine-escalate`, `derivation-gap`,
`signal-starvation`, or `wrong-loop`), run a final homeostasis scan across all
five axes and every OPEN finding / anchor. A single blocked anchor is not enough
to halt the frontier loop. If product work is blocked, look for evaluator,
observability, specification, or intervention-diversity work that is reversible
and in scope. If such work exists, continue with it.

No-trigger is not no-pressure. If the current ledger has no OPEN findings and
no changed files, the loop must perform one active pressure-discovery move
before checkpointing. Examples: search for an untested project/category, audit a
recent trace against the frontier vector, add a stronger outer check for a
suspected blind spot, compare performance/cost trend, or improve the evaluator's
ability to expose the next weakness. If discovery
finds pressure, set the frontier active and continue. If discovery is blocked by
budget or external authority, halt as `PAUSED_EXTERNAL`, not checkpoint.

Homeostasis is not the end of the frontier loop; it is the signal to return to
the ramp shape at a wider radius. When known axes are balanced, the next useful
move is usually an expansion ramp: add a new project category, stronger outer
check, adversarial control, evaluator dimension, or
representation/performance measurement before resuming product improvement.
Treat the initial ramp as the first instance of this recurring pattern, not a
one-time preface.

The halt is valid only when every remaining useful intervention is either
blocked by the same external authority, outside scope, or low-yield same-family
polish with no fresh evidence, the active pressure-discovery move found no new
admissible pressure, and no expansion-ramp option exists inside scope/budget.
Record the pressure fields and include the scan in the final response:

```text
halt scan:
- oracle trustworthiness: <balanced/drifting/blocked> - <why no safe move>
- product capability: <balanced/drifting/blocked> - <why no safe move>
- failure legibility: <balanced/drifting/blocked> - <why no safe move>
- specification coherence: <balanced/drifting/blocked> - <why no safe move>
- intervention diversity: <balanced/drifting/blocked> - <why no safe move>
pressure discovery: <what was searched/evaluated> - <pressure found or why none>
expansion ramp: <new radius considered> - <ramp started or why none>
pressure_status: <open/paid/blocked/exhausted>
pressure_debt: <none/low/medium/high/explicitly_deferred>
checkpoint_reason: <plateau_after_active_pressure/budget_exhausted/evaluator_invalid/risk_limit_hit/target_gap_unresolved/negative_result_saved; required for every checkpoint; pressure_status=open checkpoint is invalid>
next_pressure: <next trace/artifact/dimension/intervention or none-with-reason>
```

### Intervention labels (reference glossary)

The intervention corresponds to one of these labels. Do not pick the label
first; the axis in disturbance implies the label.

- restoring oracle trustworthiness → `evaluator`
- restoring product capability → `product`
- restoring failure legibility → `observability`
- restoring specification coherence → `specification`
- restoring intervention diversity → whichever axis has been
  under-corrected
- nothing to restore → `stop-and-summarize`

## Rules

{{SCOPE_MANIFEST}}

### Closure discipline (FIXED ≠ CLOSED)

A change authored by the iteration is `FIXED_PENDING_CONFIRMATION`, not
`CLOSED`. Closure requires either the next iteration's review pass
explicitly confirming, or the next pass not re-raising the finding. Halt
conditions count OPEN only; `FIXED_PENDING_CONFIRMATION` is not cleared.

### Frontier status taxonomy

Do not use generic `DEFERRED`. Every anchor or artifact row that is not green
must carry one of these statuses:

- `OPEN` — pressure remains and the next admissible intervention is known or
  discoverable.
- `FIXED_PENDING_CONFIRMATION` — changed this iteration; needs a later pass or
  independent oracle before closure.
- `CLOSED_CONFIRMED` — independently confirmed fixed.
- `CLOSED_EXPECTED_RED_CONTROL` — intentionally failing control that proves the
  evaluator rejects bad output.
- `PAUSED_EXTERNAL` — blocked on explicit external authority, budget, secret, or
  unavailable live channel.
- `REJECTED_OUT_OF_SCOPE` — not part of this frontier's scope.

An improvement opportunity implies `OPEN` or `PAUSED_EXTERNAL` unless the row is a
`CLOSED_EXPECTED_RED_CONTROL` whose purpose is to stay red.

### Status-theater prohibition

Do not emit upfront plans or rollout narration. Do not produce completion
summaries mid-run. Traces, diffs, and oracle outputs are truth; notes are
memory.

### Same-family admissibility (forcing function)

Intervention-diversity disturbance (see homeostasis axes) is not
satisfied by cosmetic corrections. When the findings / ledger surface
(or, absent one, recent commits) shows same-family concentration — the
same invariant-kind applied across different surfaces or enums — the
next accepted change must do at least one of:

- shift intervention to a different disturbed axis, or
- cite a fresh failing trace, external finding, or blocked claim that
  makes another same-axis move genuinely necessary, or
- halt / escalate with `stop-and-summarize` because only low-yield
  same-family work remains.

Cosmetic, rustfmt, file-rotation, naming-cleanup, or ledger-only
changes do **not** break concentration. They must be bundled with
substantive work on another axis, or deferred until a new finding
surfaces. Noticing concentration and then discharging the requirement
with a syntactic repair is an iteration to reject, not accept.

### Frontier anchor requirement

Every accepted change must cite a live frontier anchor:

- an unsatisfied acceptance row from the motive,
- an OPEN finding in the findings / ledger surface,
- a failing trace or selector from the current iteration, or
- a missing evaluator artifact or named degraded-coverage gap.

Free-floating hardening, refactoring, or legibility polish without an
anchor is valid only when another homeostasis axis is actively
disturbed and the work is the cheapest restoration. Sustained polish
without an anchor is echo, not frontier work.

**Anchor lifecycle.** Each anchor carries a `closure_criterion` and
`freshness`. An anchor cited by two accepted changes with no fresh
failing trace, changed metric, new discriminative fixture, narrowed
sub-anchor, or confirmed closure becomes **STALE** and cannot justify
the next accepted change. The next iteration must split the anchor,
strengthen the oracle, seek external review, or emit
`stop-and-summarize`.

### Additional rules

- Use traces and outputs as truth; use notes as memory.
- Treat the loop as a Pareto frontier, not a single scalar.
- Prefer additive ratchets over broad rewrites unless evidence strongly
  favors a rewrite.

### Cash-out discipline

After ramp exit, every non-product accepted change (evaluator,
observability, specification) names its product cash-out trigger: the
product question it enables, the signal that becomes stronger, the
command or artifact that will show the improvement.

After `{{CASH_OUT_N}}` consecutive non-product accepted changes at T3+,
the next accepted change must do one of:

1. use the improved signal to select or complete product work,
2. run the outer channel and update the frontier vector,
3. create or run a stronger anti-overfitting check, or
4. emit `stop-and-summarize`.

Default N = 3; set per repo as `{{CASH_OUT_N}}`.

## Halt conditions

Halt = emit `stop-and-summarize`. Escalate (rare, irreversible-only) is a
separate signal — see the Runner contract. A frontier halt is a checkpoint,
not completion.

- No OPEN findings for 2 consecutive review rounds.
{{SCOPE_DRIFT_HALT}}
- All five homeostasis axes in balance and no intervention is available
  (`homeostatic-checkpoint` equilibrium).

### Halt-cause classifier

When emitting `stop-and-summarize` or `escalate: <reason>`, label the
cause so the user (and the next derivation) can route it back:

- `derivation-gap` — blocked on something derivation could have asked
  for. The next derivation pass adds it to the Frontload audit so this
  loop doesn't block on it again.
- `genuine-escalate` — irreversible / external / authority-needed
  (paid API budget, public-publish, secret, product direction).
- `homeostatic-checkpoint` — legitimate checkpoint; all five homeostasis axes
  in balance, no high-yield admissible intervention available. This does not
  mean the frontier is complete.
- `signal-starvation` — quiet-signal checkpoint fired; outer channel
  ran or stop-and-summarize.
- `wrong-loop` — the work belongs in a different loop type (a
  finite-checklist closure should reroute to the `goal` archetype via `/loopgen`).

### Frontier checkpoint semantics

Frontier loops do not self-complete. `homeostatic-checkpoint`,
`genuine-escalate`, `derivation-gap`, `signal-starvation`, and `wrong-loop` are
valid invocation halts, but none is completion. When halting for any frontier
cause, write:

```text
iteration halted; frontier checkpointed
```

Then list either the next pressure / unresolved OPEN findings / anchors, or the
full homeostasis scan proving no high-yield admissible intervention remains.
Do not mark a generic runner goal as complete for any frontier halt; at most,
mark the invocation complete and leave the loop artifact checkpointed, active,
or gated.

`derivation-gap` is the feedback signal. It tells the user the
checklist was incomplete; add the missed item to next run's Frontload
audit.

### Quiet-signal checkpoint

After N consecutive iterations with the cheap channel green, no new
failing trace, and no new finding added to the findings / ledger
surface, run the expensive outer channel to introduce fresh signal —
or emit `stop-and-summarize`. Signal starvation (quiet oracle, quiet
review surface) is the state in which the loop most readily mines
locally-admissible polish; the checkpoint prevents indefinite
polishing by forcing either new evidence or honest halt.
Default N = 3; set per repo as `{{QUIET_SIGNAL_N}}`.

## Artifacts to maintain

- **Ledger** — concise state / hypotheses / outcomes (memory).
- **Structured traces** — failures produce queryable artifacts, not just
  stderr.
- **Metric outputs** — machine-readable, persisted across iterations.

## Ramp block

```md
## Ramp

This repository is not yet at main-loop maturity. Before frontier-seeking
optimization can proceed, the loop must build the measurement apparatus.
Ramp is not prelude, not procrastination, and not failure — it is the
runway the main loop needs.

Missing ramp stages: {{RAMP_MISSING_STAGES}}

### Ramp-axes (weighted above main-loop axes until exit)

- **Harness completeness** — are canonical build / test / run commands
  known and working? Is there a cheap validator that runs every iteration?
- **Signal discrimination** — do tests and validators distinguish
  working from compile-passing? Are false greens named?
- **Trace legibility** — when a failure happens, does it produce a
  structured artifact the next iteration can read without re-running?

### Ramp stages to close

{{RAMP_STAGES_DETAIL}}

### Ramp is deep, multi-iteration work

Each stage may take many iterations. A single stage may span a PR or a
branch. Do not rush stages; do not treat ramp as a checkbox list.

### Stage closure cards

A stage is not closed by prose. Each closure produces a card:

- `stage`
- `verifier_command` — the exact command that proves the stage
- `expected_green` — what passes on a known-good state
- `expected_red` — what fails under a deliberate broken case, mutation,
  sentinel, or known defect (or `none-known` with justification)
- `failure_artifact` — path / query showing the produced failure trace
- `false_green_eliminated` — the named false-green class or `none-known`
- `reopen_condition` — the evidence that would reopen the stage

Stricter closure for stages 3–5: stage 3 (smoke validator) demonstrates at
least one obvious breakage caught; stage 4 (discriminative signal) needs
a red/green pair, mutation sentinel, or known-defect reproduction (a
passing test alone does not close stage 4); stage 5 (trace
infrastructure) induces at least one failure and shows the artifact is
queryable without rerun.

### Ramp exit criterion

Ramp is complete when all five hold:

1. Canonical commands exist and return 0 on a known-good state.
2. A baseline snapshot records current green / red / flaky state.
3. A cheap validator runs every iteration and catches obvious breakage.
4. Signal is discriminative: tests fail when behavior is wrong, not when
   syntax is broken. False-green rate is known and low.
5. Failures produce structured traces the next iteration can query.

When all five hold, emit `ramp-complete` in iteration output. The next
iteration switches to main-loop homeostasis. Stages 6–9 (search set,
anti-overfitting split, metric surfacing, golden principles) continue as
ordinary evaluator / observability work inside the main loop.
```

## Repo-specific overlay

After placeholders are populated, the derivation may append a short repo
contract at the end:

- canonical commands
- artifact locations
- known false-green zones
- forbidden shortcuts
- review ledger or benchmark locations

If the branch is in post-build closure mode, append the review-closure
overlay from [`review-closure-overlay.md`](../../references/review-closure-overlay.md).
