# Composed Prompt — assembly skeleton

This file is **not** an emittable prompt. It is the recipe `/loopgen` Phase 3
follows to assemble `loop/PROMPT.md` from three inputs:

1. the nearest archetype's **body template** — `templates/bodies/<archetype>-body.md`,
2. the shared **primitive blocks** — `primitives/*.md`,
3. the classified **primitive bundle + divergences** from Phase 2.

The body templates are the four legacy emittable prompts (frontier / goal /
story copied verbatim; greenfield reconstructed). This skeleton defines the
union section order, the new provenance preamble, and the patch/degrade/strip
logic that turns a body template into a composed prompt.

## Section order (union of all archetype bodies)

1. **Header line** — archetype-specific ("You are running …").
2. **Provenance preamble** — ALWAYS (format below). NEW; the one section the
   legacy skills never emitted.
3. **Motive** — ALWAYS.
4. **Runner contract** — ALWAYS (`primitives/runner-contract.md`).
5. **Judgment default** — ALWAYS (`primitives/judgment-default.md`); in
   `greenfield` it is carried by invariant 7 instead, so it is not emitted twice.
6. **Frontload preamble** — ALWAYS (`primitives/frontload-audit.md` output).
7. **Archetype body** — the nearest archetype's body, placeholders filled.
   Conditional sub-sections by archetype:
   - `frontier`: Frontier vector · Core law · Homeostasis (5 axes) · Evaluator
     maturity · Reward channels · Same-family admissibility · Frontier anchor.
   - `goal`: Oracle principles · Terminal contract · Goal version · Acceptance
     inventory · Verifier discipline · Channels · Dependency topology ·
     Oracle-drift guard.
   - `story`: Core objects · Status model · Lane/surface · Storyboard ·
     Mechanical run contract · Bootstrap · (Surface Taste Lane — conditional).
   - `greenfield`: 11 invariants · Capability surface · Phase gates.
8. **Signal hierarchy** — `primitives/evidence-tier.md`. Carried by the
   `frontier` / `story` / `greenfield` bodies; **not** `goal` (which relies on
   oracle principles + the acceptance inventory as its evidence surface). Do
   not add a standalone Signal-hierarchy section to a `goal` prompt — the legacy
   goal prompt never had one, and adding it breaks U11.
9. **Iteration protocol** — archetype body.
10. **Rules** — archetype body (scope manifest, closure discipline FIXED≠CLOSED,
    status-theater prohibition, forbidden shortcuts; `frontier` adds same-family
    admissibility + frontier anchor; `goal` adds the oracle-drift guard).
11. **Halt conditions** — archetype body + **Halt-cause classifier** ALWAYS
    (`primitives/halt-cause-classifier.md`, including the archetype's terminal
    cause).
12. **Artifacts to maintain** — the archetype's queue (`artifact-shape`).
13. **Overlays** — review-closure (`frontier` closure mode); Surface Taste Lane
    (`story` taste lane).

**The body template is authoritative for which sections appear.** This union
list is the *superset* across archetypes; a section appears in a composed prompt
only if that archetype's body carries it. A shared block already inlined in a
body is **not** re-emitted from its primitive file (no double-emission), and the
assembler never adds a section the archetype's legacy body lacked — doing so
breaks the U11 backward-compat invariant.

## Provenance preamble (ALWAYS — emit with values filled)

```md
> **Loop provenance — composed by `/loopgen`.**
> Archetype: `<nearest>`  ·  Divergences: `<axis: value (source); …>` or `none`.
> Consult-capability: `tier-N` (`<channel, or "none — human-look gate substituted">`).
> Evaluator tier: `<T0–T6, or n/a>`.
> Frontload — resolved: [`…`]; defaulted: [`…`]; open gaps: [`…`].
> Primitive sources: `<files whose values diverged from the archetype defaults>`.
> Re-derive (do not hand-edit) when intent, sources, or environment change.
```

Red-flag rule: if any emitted section reads "the archetype" without the
provenance preamble naming which primitive values composed it, the composition
is invisible — the preamble MUST enumerate every divergence axis + its source.

## Assembly procedure (Phase 3 follows this)

1. **Load** `templates/bodies/<nearest>-body.md`.
2. **Resolve includes.** For each `{{INCLUDE primitives/X.md}}` marker, inline
   the block that follows the `---` spec separator in that primitive file.
3. **Fill placeholders** from the frontload audit + primitive bundle.
4. **Prepend** the Provenance preamble with values filled.
5. **Apply divergence patches.** For every axis where the bundle diverges from
   the archetype default, replace the archetype's default section with the
   diverging value's section and name it in provenance:
   - `cadence-shape` → swap the checkpoint/cadence block (e.g. chapter cadence
     into a frontier body).
   - `convergence-shape` → swap the stop-signal block (e.g. capstone-plus-closer).
   - `halt-shape` → swap the reopen-policy block (e.g. checkpoint-with-reopen).
   - `artifact-shape` → swap the queue artifact section + change the EXTRA
     emitted file accordingly.
   Patches are additive/substitutive; they must not perturb untouched sections.
6. **Apply consult degradation** (`primitives/consult-capability.md`):
   - `tier-0` → remove every consult-dependent section (blind comprehension
     reads, scheduled creative consults, adversarial refute panels) and insert
     a periodic human-look gate; record the degradation in provenance.
   - `tier-1` → replace programmatic consults with an async human-bridge handoff.
   - `tier-2`/`tier-3` → keep the consult sections (tier-3 enables blind
     adversarial multi-tool consults).
7. **Strip dead sections.** Remove any section whose `{{placeholder}}` was not
   substituted. If any `{{…}}` survives, WARN in the emit summary — the emitted
   prompt must contain no dead sections.
8. **Verify halt semantics.** The emitted prompt must distinguish invocation
   halt from archetype completion. Shared halt causes (`genuine-escalate`,
   `derivation-gap`, `signal-starvation`, `wrong-loop`) never mean the
   frontier, goal, story, or greenfield artifact is complete by themselves.
   Only the archetype-terminal success cause may claim completion. If this
   distinction is absent, patch the prompt before emitting.
   Also verify that any non-terminal shared halt requires a full search-surface
   scan first, so a single blocked row cannot stop the loop while another
   reversible in-scope intervention remains.
9. **Emit** (see `SKILL.md` Phase 4): `loop/PROMPT.md` + `loop/STATE.md` + the
   archetype's extra artifact(s).

## Backward-compatibility invariant (U11 gate)

For a **pure** archetype (no divergences; consult tier as detected), steps
1–4 + 7–8 reproduce the legacy skill's body verbatim — the ONLY added content
is the Provenance preamble. The U11 probe diffs composed output against legacy
output and accepts exactly two difference classes: (a) the provenance preamble,
(b) cosmetic whitespace/ordering. Any load-bearing structural difference on a
pure case fails the probe.
