# Story Loop

This skill derives a repo-specific Story Loop prompt. The emitted prompt
lives in [`references/story-prompt-template.md`](references/story-prompt-template.md);
the runner runs the prompt, this skill writes it.

Invoke **once per run** to author or revise the prompt. The skill's durable
artifact is the **storyboard**: a reviewable inventory of product promises,
where each promise records where it came from, how confident we are, what
would prove it, and what the latest evidence says.

## Core framing

A Story Loop is a **story-frontier loop**: each iteration discovers one
user-facing promise, makes narrow reversible product judgments when needed,
documents the alignment cost for human review, implements or verifies one
focused slice, captures evidence, and continues. It is not broad QA or a
project-management digest.

The loop should bias toward actual story / feature movement. A promoted
product iteration should make a user promise more visibly understandable,
usable, safe, recoverable, or decision-supporting. Semantic-only cleanup
can be valid support work, but repeated same-family low-visibility fixes
are a drift signal unless they unblock a selected story or repair a
misleading rendered contract.

The storyboard is an *index of evidence and intent*, not the source of
intent itself. Authority lives in human prompts, current docs, accepted
issues/PRs, and reviewer guidance — re-check those before treating an old
row as truth (see the template's Forbidden Moves).

## Relationship to other skills

These are *optional integrations*; if they are not available in the host
environment, Story Loop performs the responsibility directly or emits a
handoff.

- A **work-tracking adapter** (host-specific: Linear, GitHub Issues,
  Slack, vault) — synthesizes external context. Do not make the skill
  depend on a particular adapter.
- An **acceptance verifier** — verifies known acceptance criteria and
  emits evidence reports after a story has criteria.
- An **e2e-test harness** — owns browser / dev-server mechanics when
  verifying a running app.
- An **implementation skill** (e.g. `goal-loop` for a finite acceptance
  inventory, or any host-provided builder) — may fix larger product
  failures after Story Loop classifies them. Story Loop itself may still
  implement one narrow, reversible, evidence-backed story per iteration.
- `frontier-loop` (sibling) — appropriate when the storyboard exposes
  evaluator blindness, missing proof surfaces, or a broader frontier
  question.

## Frontloading discipline

Loops fail when they self-terminate blocked on a decision the user could
have made before the loop fired. The derivation step's job is to
**frontload every uncertainty** so iteration runs through the night
without blocking.

At derivation time, for every thing the loop might need (lane, surface,
storyboard, fixture, app URL, …), do one of:

1. **Resolve it now.** If the host has an AskUserQuestion-style tool,
   use it. Otherwise print the uncertainty prominently in the
   derivation response so the user can answer before launching.
2. **Default + Alignment Review.** Pick the smallest reversible default
   and record an Alignment Review.
3. **Mark as escalate candidate.** Only for the truly irreversible.

Anything left over is a **derivation gap** — a future block waiting to
happen. The Pre-flight Frontload audit (below) lists what was resolved
/ defaulted / deferred; the emitted prompt's halt-cause classifier
flags `derivation-gap` halts so the next derivation pass closes them.

## Derivation procedure

### Pre-flight: Frontload audit

Before §1, walk this checklist. For each item: **resolve**
(AskUserQuestion if available, else print prominently), **default +
Alignment Review**, or **escalate-mark**. Record in `loop/STATE.md`
under `frontload:` and prepend a brief frontload preamble to the
emitted `loop/PROMPT.md`.

- **Motive** — one-sentence goal.
- **Selected lane** — e.g. `Surface Taste Lane`, or a domain-named
  lane.
- **Selected surface class** — generic, repo-local
  (audience/workflow/surface name the project uses).
- **Storyboard format and path** — `docs/storyboard.md` (human) or
  `.yaml` (machine); prefer the repo's existing convention.
- **App URL** — for local verification, if in scope.
- **Fixtures / seeds / auth** — what the proof recipe needs.
- **Dev-server runnable** — yes / no / unknown; if no, record
  `env-gap` instead of attempting verification.
- **Evidence-capture path** — where screenshots / DOM / traces go.
- **Adjacent capability availability** — work-tracking adapter,
  acceptance verifier, e2e harness, implementation skill, sibling loops:
  present or not in the host environment?
- **Consult availability** — frontier-model channel for Surface Taste
  blind reads (if applicable).
- **Existing storyboard state** — rows present? freshness? alignment
  status of top rows?

A derivation that doesn't close all of these — at least to defaults —
emits a frontload preamble naming the open gaps so the user can decide
before sleeping.

### 1. Inspect the evidence surface

Read the repo to ground the derivation:

- Existing storyboard, if any (`docs/storyboard.{md,yaml}` or similar).
  Note format and whether rows are current.
- Strongest available guidance sources (see template `## Core objects`):
  human prompt + current branch context, vision/product docs, README +
  routes + UI copy, tests + Storybook, issues/PRs/changelogs/reviews,
  observed running UI, analytics/support notes.
- Proof surface inventory: dev-server runnable? `app_url` known? fixtures
  / seed / auth requirements? evidence-capture conventions?
- Selected branch, recent PRs, and any retro notes from prior Story Loop
  runs.

Record what is present and what is missing. Missing proof surfaces become
either `fixture-gap` / `env-gap` candidates (default judgment + log) or
escalates (rare, irreversible-only).

### 2. Select lane and surface class

Identify the lane and the selected surface class:

- Use the user's prompt when explicit; otherwise infer from the strongest
  guidance source and record the inference as an Alignment Review.
- The surface class should be **generic and repo-local** — the
  audience/workflow/surface names the project itself uses. Do not
  hard-code product-specific audiences in the emitted prompt.
- Use **Surface Taste Lane** when the goal is visual / product / frontend
  quality. Use a domain-specific lane name when the user names one
  (e.g., "compliance evidence", "checkout").

A story is in-lane when it improves the selected persona's rendered
surface, workflow, state, decision, trust, or recovery on the selected
surface class.

### 3. Choose the storyboard format and path

Prefer the repo's existing convention. If none exists:

- `docs/storyboard.md` for human review.
- `docs/storyboard.yaml` for machine iteration.

The emitted prompt will operate on this single file; rows follow the
Story Record shape in the template.

### 4. Collect repo-specific inputs

From the user or by inference:

- **Motive** — one-sentence goal (e.g., "verify the evidence-anchor
  workflow on the production-data fixture").
- **Lane** + **surface class** (from step 2).
- **Storyboard path** (from step 3).
- **Fixtures / app URL** when verification is in scope.
- **Forbidden shortcuts**, if the user gave any.

### 5. Assemble the prompt

Start from [`references/story-prompt-template.md`](references/story-prompt-template.md).
Fill in:

- `{{MOTIVE}}`
- **Runner contract** — sibling skills share an identical block; keep in
  sync.
- **Judgment default** — sibling skills share an identical block; keep in
  sync.
- `{{LANE}}`, `{{SURFACE_CLASS}}`
- `{{STORYBOARD_PATH}}`

Drop the **Surface Taste Lane** section when the lane is not the taste
lane.

### 6. Emit

Return:

- `loop/PROMPT.md` — the filled-in template, ready for any runner
  (`/loop`, `/goal`, or an external harness). The prompt is the same; the
  runner only differs in invocation.
- `docs/storyboard.{md,yaml}` — initial storyboard if absent; otherwise
  unchanged.
- `loop/STATE.md` — phase, iteration counter, selected lane, selected
  surface, current story (`none` initially), last action, next action,
  and a `Next action: HALT` exit hatch the user controls.
- A short rationale: chosen lane, chosen surface class, chosen storyboard
  path/format, whether the proof surface is ready or which gap blocks
  verification.

## Diagnostic mode

Invoked to diagnose a drifting Story Loop (not author a new prompt):

1. Read the current `loop/PROMPT.md`, `docs/storyboard.{md,yaml}`, the
   most recent storyboard updates, and `loop/STATE.md`.
2. Score against the template's Forbidden Moves and iteration protocol:
   which rules are encoded? Which is the loop violating?
3. Identify the dominant failure mode: stale storyboard treated as
   authority? Repeated re-verification of easy stories? Broad QA sweep
   masquerading as verification? Verification on unaligned candidates?
   Same-family semantic cleanup crowding out story / feature movement?
   Escalate-polling where judgment should default?
4. Emit a *minimal* PROMPT.md mutation that closes the failure mode —
   not a full rewrite. The hand-evolved prompt has hard-won lessons; the
   retrofit adds what's missing without losing them.
5. Write a ⚠️ block to `loop/STATE.md` telling the next iteration what
   changed and what to do differently.
