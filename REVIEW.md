# Frontier-model review — 2026-05-22

Five ChatGPT Pro (extended) reviews of the loop skills: one adversarial design
review per skill, plus one cohesive cross-family review. This file triages the
findings — what was applied directly, and what needs a design decision.

## Cross-cutting patterns

1. **Advisory → enforceable.** Every skill names the right concept but leaves
   it to the loop's judgment. A long-lived autonomous loop exploits that. The
   recurring fix: hard gates with required fields / machine-checkable closure.
2. **Stale-target re-grounding.** Loops self-certify with self-authored
   artifacts (ledger prose, JSON they wrote). Strong signal must be external
   or machine-derived; self-authored memory cannot reset a starvation detector
   or stand in for product intent.
3. **Boundary integrity.** Each loop can quietly become the wrong loop type
   (Spark drifting into frontier search; frontier closure-mode competing with
   Spark). Loops need explicit "wrong loop — reroute" tripwires.
4. **Two real contradictions** (now fixed) — see Applied.

## Applied (this commit)

Surgical, unambiguous fixes — bugs, public hygiene, and the clearest loophole
patches. No skill changed identity or structure.

| Skill | Change |
|---|---|
| frontier-loop | **Bug:** ramp trigger said stages 3–6, but ramp-exit needs only 1–5 — a loop could be told "still ramping" and "must exit" at once. Trigger is now stages 1–5; stage 6 absence is post-ramp evaluator debt. Added a mandatory `ramp-complete` exit. |
| frontier-loop | Quiet-signal counter now resets only on *strong* signal (external finding, typed trace, oracle verdict, metric move) — not on self-authored ledger prose. Closes the "narrate new work to stay alive" loophole. |
| greenfield-loop | **Bug:** emit step 5 told the loop to render iteration-0 output before the rubric existed, contradicting invariant 1 (evaluator scaffolding precedes artifact). Step 5 is now evaluator-first. |
| greenfield-loop | Doc drift fixed: "10 invariants" → 11; "Three files" → four (README was already emitted). |
| greenfield-loop | **Public hygiene:** removed a private absolute path from Provenance. |
| spark-loop | Closure-fit classification tightened: requires a *discriminative* proof channel and an *admissible concrete anchor* (not a generic seam class); bootstrap budget is one move for the whole run. |
| story-loop | **Public hygiene:** "xBanker-specific" → "project-specific". |
| story-loop | New Forbidden Move: the storyboard is not product intent — re-check an authority source before verifying/promoting an existing story. |

## Second pass — story-loop restructure + family alignment (2026-05-22)

A targeted follow-up applied two structural calls from the deferred list,
on top of the first-pass fixes above.

### story-loop is now a prompt-generator

Previously an operational workflow (the assistant ran steps 0–7 directly).
Now mirrors frontier/spark:

- `story-loop/SKILL.md` is a derivation procedure (inspect repo → pick
  lane/surface → choose storyboard format → fill template → emit).
- `story-loop/references/story-prompt-template.md` (new) holds the
  per-iteration playbook — every section from the old Workflow §0–7,
  Status Model, Core Objects, Forbidden Moves, and Minimal Output is
  preserved verbatim.
- Emits `loop/PROMPT.md` + `docs/storyboard.{md,yaml}` + `loop/STATE.md`.

### All four skills are runner-agnostic + judgment-default

The owner's framing: `/loop`, `/goal`, and external harnesses (gnhf,
cocc, ralph) are the same thing minus a small invocation difference. The
same prompt now runs under any of them. Two shared blocks (duplicated per
skill to survive the per-skill symlink install model):

- **Runner contract** — names the runner abstraction explicitly, declares
  two logical signals (`stop-and-summarize` for halt, `escalate: <reason>`
  for rare irreversible blockers), and disowns external ceilings as a
  runner concern. Inserted into both `*-prompt-template.md` files and the
  emitted story-loop prompt.
- **Judgment default** — adopts story-loop's pattern family-wide: when
  the iteration hits a taste-based or inferred call, prefer the narrow
  reversible choice + log an Alignment Review (problem · options ·
  chosen contract · alignment cost · rollback trigger · review question)
  and continue. Escalate only for the genuinely irreversible.

greenfield-loop's invariant 7 (AWAIT mode) was the most polling-shaped
piece — rewritten as "Judgment default + bounded escalate", preserving
the narrow trigger list (paid APIs without budget caps, public-publish,
secrets) and the 2-consecutive-same-question saturation rule.

frontier-loop and spark-loop's framing was lightly decoupled from
specific runners; their templates were already runner-neutral.

## Third pass — 19 hand-tunes (2026-05-22)

The deferred per-skill enhancements were triaged and applied (cash-out
softened to parameterized `{{CASH_OUT_N}}`, default 3; story-loop's
nested-YAML forms slimmed into terse single-level contracts matching the
family's voice).

**frontier-loop** — stage closure cards · repo-specific frontier vector ·
anchor lifecycle (stale-anchor depletion) · cash-out discipline (softened).

**greenfield-loop** — score-locked ramp state machine · role-protected
phase gates (loop / user / external ownership) · `INTENT.md` competing
target hypotheses · blind audience-comprehension tests · rubric versioning
+ score quarantine · blind adversarial consult protocol · consult
availability detection at derivation time (front-loads the limitation when
no consult channel is present).

**spark-loop** — in-prompt frontier tripwires · wrong-loop checkpoint ·
FIXED ≠ CLOSED closure discipline · constrained
`claim-falsification` / `probe-and-preserve` seam families · intro
tightened with plain language (no "seam closure" jargon at the top).

**story-loop** — explicit Bootstrap Mode · Ready Gate (intent-ready +
proof-ready split) · non-QA "no ready story" fallback · frontier novelty
rule · current-surface promise scan.

## Fourth pass — frontloading discipline as the family-level principle (2026-05-22)

Observation in conversation: the biggest concrete failure mode of these
loops is *self-terminating at 3 AM blocked on a decision the user could
have made before sleeping*. The patches above address it piecewise. This
pass names the unifying principle.

**The trinity:**

1. **Derivation = decide as much as possible.** Frontload every
   uncertainty.
2. **Iteration = narrow reversible judgment + Alignment Review.**
3. **Escalate = rare, irreversible only.**

If derivation does its job, iteration almost never blocks; the loop runs
through the night.

**What was added** to each of the four skills:

- **`## Frontloading discipline`** — a shared block (duplicated per skill
  to survive the symlink install model) naming the principle and the
  resolve / default / escalate-mark choices. The discipline explicitly
  privileges **AskUserQuestion** when the host provides it; otherwise
  printing the uncertainty prominently in the derivation response is the
  expected behaviour.
- **Pre-flight: Frontload audit** — a skill-specific checklist that runs
  *before* §1 of the derivation procedure. For each item the skill
  resolves / defaults / escalate-marks, then records the result in
  `loop/STATE.md` under `frontload:` and prepends a frontload preamble
  to the emitted `loop/PROMPT.md`. The user sees, before sleeping,
  exactly what was resolved, what was defaulted, and what's an escalate
  candidate.
- **Halt-cause classifier** in the emitted prompt: every `stop-and-summarize`
  or `escalate:` is labelled (`derivation-gap` · `genuine-escalate` ·
  legitimate-completion · `signal-starvation` · `wrong-loop`).
  `derivation-gap` is the feedback signal — it tells the user the
  Frontload audit missed something; the next derivation closes it.

The README now opens with the same principle so anyone cloning the repo
reads it before the skill files.

## Fifth pass — goal-loop landed as /oracle-design distillation (2026-05-23)

`goal-loop` exists. It's the family-voice distillation of `/oracle-design`,
the heavyweight ancestor (47KB SKILL.md + case studies + references). Kept:

- the **four oracle principles** (binary · independence · consumer-side ·
  anti-theater / FIXED ≠ CLOSED),
- a **slim subset of the 18 invariants** (the ones about *verifier
  honesty*, not multi-agent harness mechanics),
- the **PASS_PENDING_FINAL → PASS** state distinction (one verifier
  passing isn't terminal; the final-verify must prove the whole inventory
  in one repo state),
- **Oracle Change Notes** inline in `loop/STATE.md` (no separate
  oracle-change-cards file),
- the anti-patterns table (trimmed).

Dropped (syntax-heavy bureaucracy `/loop` and `/goal` make unnecessary):

- multi-agent `PROMPT_build.md` + `PROMPT_acceptance.md` split (default;
  available as `loop/PROMPT_verify.md` for high-stakes runs),
- `loop.sh` runnable harness (runner contract replaces it),
- Phase + TICKET-ID decomposition (flat acceptance inventory),
- `[lane:acceptance]` / `[expect:fail]` tags (prose rules),
- Motivation Trace / Risk-to-Oracle Compilation as separate derivation
  steps (folded into the verifier-design step),
- Representation Boundary Analysis (too specialized).

**Files**: `goal-loop/SKILL.md`,
`goal-loop/references/goal-prompt-template.md`,
`goal-loop/references/oracle-principles.md`. Total ~700 lines vs
`/oracle-design`'s 47KB.

**`/architect` compose**: goal-loop's derivation §1 names `/architect`
blueprints as a first-class criteria source. A U-ID becomes an AC-ID, a
test scenario becomes `pass_evidence` + `fail_evidence`, the decisive
choice becomes `authority`. The only new work goal-loop does on top of
`/architect` output is wire the `verifier` commands and define the
`final-verify`.

## Sixth pass — spark-loop retired from the public family (2026-05-23)

`spark-loop` is removed from the repo. The whole family is now four
prompt-generator skills: `frontier-loop` · `goal-loop` · `greenfield-loop` ·
`story-loop`. `spark-loop`'s content lives in git history (commits up to
`68c6ed8`); restoration is a `git revert`/`git checkout` away if real
usage later argues for it.

**Trigger.** Owner flagged spark-loop as an experiment with unclear
identity. Second-opinion consultation (ChatGPT Pro Extended Thinking,
fire-and-forget via Agentify; PAL trio was unavailable) returned a
"demote, don't delete" verdict at confidence 0.74. Owner went one
step further: remove entirely.

**Verdict-summary** (paraphrased from the consultation):

- `goal-loop` subsumes the *clean* terminal case but not Spark's
  *opportunistic* "close next live seam" posture. The difference is
  real but the overlap is large enough that public users won't
  understand why both exist.
- The 8-family seam taxonomy contained earned design language but parts
  read as internal vocabulary, not user-facing routing.
- The naming concern was a polite signal of a deeper placement issue.
  The other 4 skills produce immediate routing reflex; spark required
  the reader to learn "seam closure" before they could decide. That's
  the real disqualification.
- Public top-level skills need immediate routing clarity. Spark hadn't
  earned that.

**Promotion criteria** (if future dogfooding argues for restoration).
The wisdom from spark-loop's closure discipline lives on in goal-loop's
verifier discipline + the oracle principles. A future `closing-loop` or
`spark-loop` deserves a sibling slot back only if real runs show it is
clearly better than a 1-row `goal-loop` for at least two of:

- review-feedback closure,
- operator-bug-with-repro,
- known-false-green hardening,
- latency / failure-legibility seam,
- repeated-workaround compression.

If none of those win, the sibling slot was the wrong shape and the
content lives correctly inside `goal-loop`.

**Sibling reroutes updated:**

- `goal-loop` core framing rebuilt to stand alone (no longer "spark-loop
  generalized" — it's "closure-shaped + terminal + multi-criterion", with
  an explicit note that a 1-row inventory is fine).
- `frontier-loop`, `greenfield-loop`, `story-loop`, `goal-loop`
  halt-cause `wrong-loop` reroutes drop spark as a target and point at
  `goal-loop` for finite-checklist closure work.
- `story-loop`'s `product-fail` handoff (was: `spark-loop` or `build`)
  now points at `goal-loop` with a 1-row inventory.
- README routing line drops the `close one known seam` row.

## Seventh pass — god-loop drafted, then retracted (2026-05-23 → 2026-05-24)

`god-loop/` was drafted as a v0 / experimental meta-skill (commit
`609ba2a`) and **retracted within ~24h without dogfooding** (the
retract commit removes it from `main`). Reasoning, in plain terms:

- A second-opinion consultation (GPT Pro Extended) on family coverage
  delivered the same verdict as the prior /meta in this thread: *"add
  only when real runs need it; pick empirically-earned shapes over full
  coverage. A new sibling earns public status only when existing
  siblings plus overlays repeatedly produce the wrong failure mode."*
- god-loop was authored on the same impulse that retired spark-loop
  (design without usage evidence) — applying the spark standard to
  god-loop, it hadn't earned a sibling slot either. Retracting it now
  closes the consistency gap.
- The content survives in git history at `609ba2a`. If real
  multi-mode runs later prove the case for it, the restoration cost
  is one `git revert`.

The architectural insight stands: homeostasis lifted one level (modes
as axes) is a real generalization of frontier-loop's homeostasis-
over-axes. Retraction is about *when*, not *whether*.

## Eighth pass — promotion-bar rule on paper (2026-05-24)

A self-imposed rule added to the Still-deferred section below, naming
the dogfooding-citation requirement for new siblings, overlays, and
structural refactors. This is the rule GPT Pro named, that the spark
retirement implicitly applied, and that this thread has invoked /meta
twice to surface. Putting it on paper so the next "what should we add?"
question lands against a written bar instead of a vibe.

## Still deferred

Family-structural calls still need human judgment. Until the rule below
is satisfied, *no further additions land on `main`*.

### Promotion-bar rule (adopted 2026-05-24)

> No new sibling skill, overlay, or structural refactor lands on `main`
> without a **dogfooding citation** — a concrete run on a real project
> that surfaced the failure mode the addition addresses. Frontier-model
> recommendations log as candidates here (below); drafts wait for a real
> run before promoting. This is the same bar the spark retirement
> implicitly applied (commits up to `68c6ed8`) and the god-loop
> retraction explicitly applied.

### Logged candidates (awaiting dogfooding evidence)

- **`inquiry-loop`** (GPT Pro coverage-gap consultation, 2026-05-23,
  confidence 0.78). Distinct epistemology: artifact = a *finding*
  (causal explanation · root-cause account · narrowed surviving
  hypotheses); evidence = discriminative observation (traces · repros ·
  counterexamples · induced failures); key invariant *do not fix before
  understanding*; failure modes: narrative closure · confirmation
  fishing · fix laundering · instrumentation overfit · root-cause
  inflation · unfalsifiable finding. Earns a slot only if real debug /
  RCA arcs keep getting mis-shaped as fixes by goal/frontier.
- **`audit-loop` / cartography-loop**. Knowledge object = a coverage
  inventory (security surfaces · dep/license audits · API route
  inventories · "find every place this promise appears and classify
  its evidence"). Earns a slot only if `inquiry-loop` doesn't subsume
  the work and goal-loop preflights aren't strong enough.
- **`god-loop`** (retracted). Mode-homeostasis composer. Earns
  restoration only if a real run genuinely shifts between ≥2 modes
  within one session and manual switching is observably worse than
  a runtime classifier.

### Logged candidates (overlays, not siblings)

- **Authority-resolution overlay** (GPT Pro recommendation). Shared
  block across goal/story/frontier/greenfield: identify conflicting
  sources · rank declared authority · quarantine if no precedence ·
  propose reversible defaults · escalate for irreversible authority.
  Earns landing if any sibling repeatedly emits the
  `source-conflict → escalate` halt-cause across real runs.
- **Migration-as-goal-loop-overlay**. A documented acceptance-inventory
  template for migrations (7 row archetypes: pre-state captured · shim
  · dual-read · rehearsal · rollback · removal · final-verify). Earns
  landing only if real migration runs through goal-loop repeatedly
  lose the path-safety invariants.

### Permanently deferred structural items

- **Shared `references/loop-family-router.md` + `shared-loop-contract.md`.**
  A truly shared file dangles under per-skill symlink install; this pass
  resolved to per-skill duplication of the short Runner-contract /
  Judgment-default blocks. A router would need either heavy per-skill
  duplication or an installer that brings the family together.

The full review text for each skill is preserved in the ChatGPT Pro
threads.
